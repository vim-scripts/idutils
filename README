  You can use all the regular quickfix commands to traverse from one hit to
    another.
                                                                              
      :h quickfix 
                                                                              
  Each time you run IDGrepAdd, the new list of matches are added to the
    existing list. This works the same as 'grepadd' command. If you can't
    use a single filter to get all the matches then this command helps you to
    still work with a single list instead of generating multiple lists.
                                                                              
  Use the g:IGlidcmd, g:IGfiltercmd, g:IGautoCopen global variables to set
    the path to 'lid' command, filter command name/path (defaults to 'grep')
    and if the error list window should automatically be opened (runs
    |:cwindow| at the end).
                                                                              
  You can pass as many filters as you want, each prefixed with +f option.
    The filter arguments are escaped such a way that the arguments are
    passed through the shell, unmodified to the filter.
                                                                              
Examples: 
  - Filter the lines that don't contain src.
      IDGrep main +f src
                                                                              
  - Filter the lines that contain src.
      IDGrep main +f -v src
                                                                              
  - To search for the current word in all the files and filter the results
    not containing \.java in the grepped output. This will potentially
    return all the occurences in the java files only. 
      IDGrep <cword> +f \.java 
                                                                              
  - If any argument contains spaces, then you need to protect them by
    prefixing them with a backslash.  The following will filter those lines
    that don't contain "ABC XYZ".
      IDGrep <cword> +f ABC\ XYZ
